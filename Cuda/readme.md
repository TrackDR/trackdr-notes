Able to run "Cuda Debug Focus" in Legacy Debug Mode for NSight on 980ti Kepler Architecture, probably can run on Maxwell and Pascal

Cannot run "Cuda Debug Focus" on some latest cards "Volta, Turing, Ampere" yet because they only support the NextGen debugging which does not support "Cuda Debug Focus"
